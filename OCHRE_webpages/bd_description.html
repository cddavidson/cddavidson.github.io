    <h1>DIGS 30003: Data Management for the Humanities Class Project</h1>
    <p>For my final project for this class I helped Dr. Foy Scalf with Spell 51 of the Book of the Dead</p>
    <p>This class project included making an import document that reflected the different spellings in various manuscripts</p>
    <p>which was then uploaded into OCHRE as the content pool from which all the manuscripts could be reconstructed.</p>
    <p>The words were subdivided into epigraphic units, the smallest constituent elements of the words.</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-sm">
          <img src="../../Images/BD/epigraphic_units.png" class="img-fluid" width="188" height="250">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
          <img src="../../Images/BD/discourse_hierarchy.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="188" height="250">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>These epigraphic units were then joined to create discourse units. For example, <U>h</U>r.t-n<U>t</U>r is composed of three epigraphic units as shown on the left,</p>
    <p>but they are combined to make a compound word meaning "necropolis" in the discourse hierarchy shown on the right.</p>
    <p>Properties were also added to show the condition of the epigraphic units on the manuscript.</p> 
    <p>For example, when epigraphic units were damaged, rubricated, or omitted/emended, these qualities were recorded with checked boxes as shown below.</p>
    <div class="container mt-4">
      <img src="../../Images/BD/condition.png" class="img-fluid">
    </div>
    <p>The final step of the project was making high quality jpgs that could be linked from the resource hierarchy to the discourse hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Although in this case the resource hierarchy stored images, other data such as 3D models, sound files, and even maps from ArcGIS can be stored here.</p>
    <p>Dr. Scalf provided a JSESH file for each manuscript, and I divided it according to the discourse hierarchy with each line being resized to fit an artboard in Adobe Illustrator for consistency.</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-sm">
          <img src="../../Images/BD/Hieroglyphs.png" class="img-fluid" width="350" height="350">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
          <img src="../../Images/BD/resource_hierarchy.png" class="img-fluid">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The resource hierarchy also includes images of the manuscripts themselves so that Egyptologists can view the hieratic signs.</p>
    <p>Finally, each image was linked from the resource hierarchy to the appropriate place where it appears in the discourse hierarchy with the linked items pane on the right.</p>
